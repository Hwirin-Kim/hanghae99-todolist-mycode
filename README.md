기존 props를 통해 정보를 전달 및 수정 하던 방법을 리덕스를 이용하여 전역에서 state를 관리하는 방법으로 바꿈
컴포넌트는 기존 컴포넌트에 상세페이지를 하나 더 추가하였음
기존 컴포는트 구성이 화면 구성별로 잘 나뉘어져 있었고, 반복되는 Todo들도 분리가 잘 되어있어 사용하기 편리했음
List에서 todo라는 페이지로 props를 이용하여 정보전달을 사용하였는데 이는 1뎁스까지 이므로 효율적이라고 생각하여 그대로 사용하였음
상세페이지는 라우터를 이용해 각 Todo별로 다른 주소를 갖도록 하였음(/detail + 각 게시물의 id)
스타일컴포넌트를 사용하여 CSS파일을 모두 지우고 jsx파일 내에 스타일을 모두 지정하였음


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
